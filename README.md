This task We can solve this by using supervised machine learning classification algorithm.Decision tree is used for both classification and regression.

we are loading iris flower datasets using sklearn library. 

In the output we can see that the shape of data is (150, 4) which means we have 150 samples (rows)and 4 features (columns).
4 features are : sepal length , sepal width, petal length , petal width. The features have some values (150 sample) based on that flowers 
classified in three category that is setosa ,versicolor and virginica (0,1 and 2).On the basis of features () we will decide which flower belongs to which category by training the model with the datasets that we have.



We know that by definition decision tree is a tree shaped flowchart-like structure (reversed tree) with nodes (leaf), branches and decision making conditions.
Iris Datasets:Iris is a family of flower which contains three type of flower called setosa ,versicolor and Virginica
